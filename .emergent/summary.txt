The AI engineer, E1, initiated the development of a full-stack application for Acces Services, a pest control company, focusing on a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The initial setup included a basic React app and a FastAPI server with a  prefix, adhering to strict URL and environment variable guidelines.

The development trajectory began with E1 generating a basic React app and then, upon user request, proceeding to build all necessary frontend pages for the Acces Services website. This involved creating eleven distinct pages (e.g., Home, DeratisationParis, Contact) and a Header component, initially with mock data and a focus on design guidelines (Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS, responsive design, specific color palettes). E1 encountered and resolved issues like missing page files during initial rendering checks.

Following the successful creation and verification of the initial frontend structure, the user requested design refinements: adding background images to hero sections, simplifying the navigation menu by removing Devis express, ensuring button text is single-line, correcting the logo to Acces Services, and removing Made with Emergent branding. E1 successfully implemented these design changes across all pages, utilizing the  for image selection.

Subsequently, the user tasked E1 with maximizing SEO. E1 responded by implementing a comprehensive SEO strategy, including optimizing meta-tags, adding JSON-LD structured data (, , , ), Open Graph and Twitter Card optimizations, local SEO targeting Paris, semantic HTML, and technical SEO files. This required installing  for proper meta-tag management. The SEO work involved creating a  component and integrating it into various pages.

The conversation concluded with the user reporting a critical issue: je ne vois pas les pages dans github ?. This indicates a potential deployment or repository visibility problem, which is now the immediate pending task. The backend, while set up, has remained largely untouched beyond initial routes.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React:** Frontend framework for building the user interface.
-   **FastAPI:** Python backend framework for API services.
-   **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for data persistence.
-   **Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS:** Component library and utility-first CSS framework for styling and responsive design.
-   **:** For client-side routing in React.
-   **:** For making HTTP requests to the backend.
-   **:** For managing meta-tags and SEO.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. Communication between frontend and backend uses  prefixed routes and  from environment variables.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Main entry point for the React application, sets up routing.
    *   **Changes:** Initially a basic Hello World component. Modified to include , , and  components to handle navigation to the various pages (Home, DeratisationParis, etc.). It was also updated to import  and other page components.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Contains the main navigation, logo, and calls-to-action (CTAs) for the entire site.
    *   **Changes:** Created to implement the navigation menu. Subsequent edits removed the Devis express button, changed the logo text to Acces Services, ensured the phone CTA button text (Appelle-nous) was on a single line, and removed Made with Emergent.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/SEOHead.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Centralized component for managing dynamic SEO meta-tags and structured data for each page.
    *   **Changes:** Created to encapsulate  and  from , allowing page-specific SEO attributes to be passed as props (title, description, keywords, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, structured data).
*   **/app/frontend/src/pages/\*.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Each file represents a specific page of the website.
    *   **Changes:** Multiple files were created (e.g., , , , etc.) to build out the site's content. They were later modified to include background images in hero sections, integrate the  component for page-specific SEO, and ensure adherence to design guidelines.
*   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    *   **Importance:** Manages frontend dependencies.
    *   **Changes:**  was added as a new dependency to support the SEO optimization.
*   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    *   **Importance:** Defines backend API routes and handles MongoDB interactions.
    *   **Changes:** Initial setup included a  prefix, a  endpoint returning Hello World, and  endpoints for creating and retrieving status checks with a MongoDB connection. No significant changes were made during this trajectory as development focused on the frontend.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate why the pages are not visible in GitHub as reported by the user. This is a critical issue that needs immediate attention.
-   Implement the backend logic for the contact form and other dynamic features not yet integrated.
-   Integrate frontend with backend services, replacing mock data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed extensive SEO optimization for the Acces Services website. This involved creating a  component to dynamically manage meta-tags (, , ), Open Graph properties (, , ), Twitter Cards, and comprehensive JSON-LD structured data (e.g., , , , , ). The  library was installed and integrated to facilitate these SEO enhancements. Each relevant page (, , , etc.) was updated to utilize this  component, passing in specific content to maximize local SEO for Paris and IDF regions. The site was configured for rich snippets and improved search engine visibility.

The last action performed was a screenshot verification (Chat Message 47) which confirmed the SEO optimizations, and E1 provided a detailed summary of the applied SEO strategies (Chat Message 48).

However, the current state of the product is now in question due to the user's latest message (Chat Message 50): je ne vois pas les pages dans github ?. This indicates a potential issue with the deployment, version control, or hosting of the frontend pages, which was not part of the development tasks but is a critical blocker.
